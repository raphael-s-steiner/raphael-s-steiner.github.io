    title: "About me"
    text: I am currently enjoying being a Hermann-Weyl-Instructor at ETH in Zurich. Previously, I've been a member at the IAS in Princeton and before that I was doing my Ph.D. at the University of Bristol under the joint supervision by <a href="https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tbrownin/">Tim Browning</a> and <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/people/andrew-r-booker/index.html">Andrew Booker</a>. My topics of interest lie in analytic number theory. Currently, I'm particularly interested in Automorphic Forms and their distributional aspects. <br><br>
    Before university I participated in the <a href="http://www.imosuisse.ch">Swiss Math Olympiad</a>, where I've won a complete set of medals over the three years I participated. I further qualified for the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">International Math Olympiad</a>, where I won a bronze medal in my last year. After participating I joined the organisation team of the <a href="http://www.imosuisse.ch">Swiss Math Olympiad</a>, where I was quite active until recently. Over the years some of my problems made it into different exams and you can find a nice selection thereof in the <a href="https://people.math.ethz.ch/~steinrap/olymp">Olympiad Problems</a> section.
