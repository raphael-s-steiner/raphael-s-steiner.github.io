    title: "About me"
    text: "I had the pleasure of being a Hermann-Weyl-Instructor at ETH in Zurich. Previously, I've been a member at the IAS in Princeton and before that I was doing my Ph.D. at the University of Bristol under the joint supervision by [Tim Browning](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~tbrownin/) and [Andrew Booker](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/people/andrew-r-booker/index.html). My topics of interest lie in analytic number theory. Currently, I'm particularly interested in Automorphic Forms and their distributional aspects. <br>
    <br>
    Before university I participated in the [Swiss Math Olympiad](https://mathematical.olympiad.ch/), where I've won a complete set of medals over the three years I participated. I further qualified for the [International Math Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/), where I won a bronze medal in my last year. After participating I joined the organisation team of the [Swiss Math Olympiad](https://mathematical.olympiad.ch/), where I was quite active until recently. Over the years some of my problems made it into different exams and you can find a nice selection thereof in the [Olympiad section](/olymp)."

        abstract: "In the prequel, a sharp bound in the level aspect on the fourth moment of Hecke--Maaß forms with an inexplicit (in fact exponential) dependency on the eigenvalue was given. In this paper, we develop further the framework of explicit theta test functions in order to capture the eigenvalue more precisely. We use this to reduce a sharp hybrid fourth moment bound to an intricate counting problem. Unconditionally, we give a hybrid bound, which is sharp in the level aspect and with a slightly larger than convex dependency on the eigenvalue."

      - title: "Rethinking metallic luster and iridescence in animal coloration"
        abstract: "Some structural colors in nature are frequently described as metallic. For example, hummingbird plumage, jewel beetles and <i>Morpho</i> butterflies have this attribute. While much attention has been paid to describing the often-shifting hues of these structural colors, there has been little interest in explaining why they appear metallic. In this paper, we argue that the metallic luster (the metallic appearance or sheen) of some structural colors arises in part from a combination of two factors: a colored specular reflection and a very low diffuse reflection. Reflections with these characteristics are found in metals and are distinct from other material reflections in nature. We propose that metallic luster can be classified based on these two reflectance properties (colored specular reflection and low diffuse reflection). We also suggest that some of the ambiguity surrounding the term \"iridescent structural color\" can be traced to the frequent confounding of metallic luster with a common definition of iridescence: a shift of peak spectral wavelength (often referred to as hue) with viewing angle. We show using optical models and cross-polarization imaging of bird plumage that two types of structural colors that are often classified as \"iridescent\" and \"non-iridescent\" both display iridescence—but only one type has metallic luster. By considering metallic luster and iridescence separately, we simultaneously clarify terminology in structural colors and open up many new lines of inquiry regarding the perception of metallic luster in animals."

        abstract: "We show that arithmetic lattices in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{R})$, stemming from the proper units of an Eichler order in an indefinite quaternion algebra over $\\mathbb{Q}$, admit a 'small' covering set. In particular, we give bounds on the diameter if the quotient space is co-compact. Consequently, we show that these lattices admit small generators. Our techniques also apply to definite quaternion algebras where we show Ramanujan-strength bounds on the diameter of certain Ramanujan graphs without the use of the Ramanujan bound."

Thereby, we strengthen a result of Xia and extend it to co-compact lattices. We realize this fourth moment by constructing a holomorphic theta kernel on $\\mathbf{G} \\times \\mathbf{G} \\times \\mathbf{SL}_{2}$, for $\\mathbf{G}$ an indefinite inner-form of $\\mathbf{SL}_2$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, based on the Bergman kernel, and considering its $L^2$-norm in the Weil variable. The constructed theta kernel further gives rise to new elementary theta series for integral quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$."

      - title: "Uniform bounds on sup-norms of holomorphic forms of real weight"
        abstract: "We establish uniform bounds for the sup-norms of modular forms of arbitrary real weight $k$ with respect to a finite index subgroup $\\Gamma$ of $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. We also prove corresponding bounds for the supremum over a compact set. We achieve this by extending to a sum over an orthonormal basis $\\sum_j y^k |f_j(z)|^2$ and analysing this sum by means of a Bergman kernel and the Fourier coefficients of Poincaré series. As such our results are valid without any assumption that the forms are Hecke eigenfunctions. Under some weak assumptions we further prove the right order of magnitude of $\\sup_{z \\in \\mathbb{H}} \\sum_j y^k |f_j(z)|^2$."
