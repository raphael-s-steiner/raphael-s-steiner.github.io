Let $f(z)=\sum A(n)n^{\frac{(kâˆ’1)}{2}} e(nz)$ be a cusp form of weight $k\ge3$ on $\Gamma_0(N)$ with character $\chi$. By studying a certain shifted convolution sum, we prove that $\sum_{n \le X} A(n^2 +h) = c_{f,h} X+O_{f,h,\epsilon}(X^{\frac{3}{4}+\epsilon}) $ for $\epsilon >0$, which improves a result of Blomer from 2008 with error $X^{\frac{6}{7}+\epsilon}$.  
This includes an appendix due to Raphael S. Steiner, proving stronger bounds for certain spectral averages.
